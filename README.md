# Pressure Sensor Pad for Real-Time Ulcer Detection
This project is a custom-built pressure sensor pad designed to detect and monitor pressure distribution in surgical and ICU settings. The goal is to identify high-risk regions for pressure ulcers in real time, aiding in preventative care for hospitalized patients.

## üî¨ Project Overview

### Motivation
Pressure ulcers are a major complication for bedridden or post-surgical patients. This device aims to reduce incidence by:
- Continuously monitoring pressure points beneath a patient
- Alerting clinicians to prolonged or high-risk pressure areas
- Improving quality of care, particularly in oncology and ICU units

### Current Capabilities
- Real-time heatmap display of pressure distribution
- High-resolution 23x32 pressure grid
- Modular design using I2C analog switches for pad scanning
- User interface for fast zone feedback

## üõ† Hardware

### Core Components
- `Arduino GIGA R1 WiFi`
- `Custom PCB` (designed in KiCad)
- `Velostat` for pressure sensing (conductive piezoresistive material)
- `ADG728 I2C Analog Switches` for row/column selection
- `Resistor network` for analog voltage division
- `GIGA Display Shield` for live visualization

### Circuit Summary
- The sensor matrix is scanned by selecting 1 row and 1 column at a time
- Voltage from each cell is read via the Arduino ADC
- All connections are routed through a custom-designed PCB

## üíª Software

### Arduino Firmware
- Collects analog pressure data from the sensor matrix
- Controls ADG728s via I2C to select matrix zones
- Sends data to GIGA Display for visualization

### Machine Learning (Planned)
- Future implementation of a denoising autoencoder to correct raw data
- Will improve signal quality and filter noise from pressure readings

## üìä Current Results
- All cells return live analog values
- Pressure heatmap successfully displayed in real time
- PCB assembled and functioning as intended
- Future test deployment planned at Cedars-Sinai surgical suite
